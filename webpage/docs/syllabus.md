# Course Syllabus
## Course Description:
Data mining is the study of efficiently finding structures and patterns in large data sets. We will focus on several aspects of this: 
* (1) converting from a messy and noisy raw data set to a structured and abstract one, 
* (2) applying scalable and probabilistic algorithms to these well-structured abstract data sets
* (3) formally modeling and understanding the error and other consequences of parts (1) and (2), including choice of data representation and trade-offs between accuracy and scalability. 

# Course Topics
* Supervised Learning - labelled data  and task driven
    1. regression — to predict one or more real values
    2. classification — to predict one of a finite number of possible outcomes
    3. probabilistic supervised learning — to predict a distribution of outcomes
* Unsupervised Learning — unlabelled data and data driven  to develop a data model
    1. clustering - divide by similarity
    2. association - identify sequence
    3. dimensionality reduction - wider dependencies
* Optimization — to fit or choose parameters in all of the models above


## Prerequisites
* Introductory programming, Mathematics and Statistics course


## Course Announcements
All the course announcement and additional materials or tutorials to help you learn the cource will be posted in the blog page of the course website. 


##  Homework late policy
Every assignment in this course is due at exactly the time stated and while I will
grade late assignments, there will be a marks deduction.

## Evaluation
The course evaluation will be a weighted mask score on class attenance and participation, homework, quizes, projects and exams.
