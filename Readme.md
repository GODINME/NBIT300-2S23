# NBIT300 - Data Mining for 2nd Semester 2023
Sorry I had everything ready for the Course and My laptop suddenly stop working and have lost all the work have done so far, so it will take me some time to get all the materials and course website ready.


# Course Description
Data mining is the study of efficiently finding structures and patterns in large data sets. We will focus on several aspects of this: 
* (1) converting from a messy and noisy raw data set to a structured and abstract one, 
* (2) applying scalable and probabilistic algorithms to these well-structured abstract data sets
* (3) formally modeling and understanding the error and other consequences of parts (1) and (2), including choice of data representation and trade-offs between accuracy and scalability. 
* These steps are essential for training as a data scientist.

* Algorithms, programming, probability, and linear algebra are required tools for understanding these approaches.

* Topics will include: similarity search, clustering, regression/dimensionality reduction, graph analysis, PageRank, and small space summaries. We will also cover several recent developments, and the application of these topics to modern applications, often relating to large internet-based companies.

* Upon completion, students should be able to read, understand, and implement ideas from many data mining research papers and books written by scientist.

* My Approach is to spend 40 percent on reviewing Linear Algebrage and Probability and 60 percent on Data Mining Algorithm.
